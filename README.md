# FireballGame

Welcome to the repository for Fireball. This was a prototype I worked on with a couple of other students during the Spring 2016 Introduction to Game Development course at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley.

Fireball is a 3D platformer where you play as a little fireball travelling through the cold forest to get to a campfire.

## How to Play

You will need to install [Panda3D](https://www.panda3d.org/) to make it all work. Then, simply run ``FireballGame > main.py``.

## Credits

Luis Angel Garcia (Me) - Level design and concept

Unnamed Computer Science Student at UTRGV - Physics and controls

Unnamed Art Student - Character design and textures

## A side note

This code was thought to be lost forever. Thankfully, we found it hiding in an old SVN repository. This project was developed for the same class as [Space Moose](https://github.com/LAG1996/SpaceMoose).
